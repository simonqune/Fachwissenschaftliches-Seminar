 abstract = {Safety assurance of automated driving systems must consider uncertain environment perception. This paper reviews literature addressing how perception testing is realized as part of safety assurance. We focus on testing for verification and validation purposes at the interface between perception and planning, and structure our analysis along the three axes 1) test criteria and metrics, 2) test scenarios, and 3) reference data. Furthermore, the analyzed literature includes related safety standards, safety-independent perception algorithm benchmarking, and sensor modeling. We find that the realization of safety-aware perception testing remains an open issue since challenges concerning the three testing axes and their interdependencies currently do not appear to be sufficiently solved.},
